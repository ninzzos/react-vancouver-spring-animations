<FadeIn>
  When Dealing with Animations, do any of these sound
  familiar? 🤔
</FadeIn>
<Appear>
  <p>Easing ↔️</p>
  <p>Timing ⏰</p>
  <p>Curves 〰️</p>
  <p>Duration ⏳</p>
</Appear>
<Notes>
  We think of animation in terms of time and curves, but
  that in itself causes most of the struggle we face when
  trying to make elements on the screen move naturally, 
  what if the user cancels the interaction, should going back
  be the same duration even though we're not all the way done?
  Nothing in the real world moves like that.

  Springs change that, a spring does not have a defined curve or a set duration, springs are cancellable,
  everything you do looks and feels natural by default, animation becomes easy and approachable.
  To better illustrate how a spring works, let’s take a look at an online tool called spring visualizer.
